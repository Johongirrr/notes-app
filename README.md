# Notes taking app

What is it? Basically it is nice app to have when you need to take important notes you take note by clicking "Create Note" button and it directs you to editing page, where you define title of note and body and at that page you can delete your note if you want. When you complete your note if you click "Main page" it leads you to Home page each note is put inside code block if you click on that code block it redirects you editing page. Additionally it show you when note is created. this message is shown in both pages.

# What technology is used?
__JavaScript__, __HTML5__, __CSS3__, __WEBPACK__, __BABEL__, 

And as storage I used localStorage for storing and removing

## Suggestions  are very welcome
